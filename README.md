**README**  
This repository contains a simple software that plays Rock Paper Scissor. 
It is just a demonstration of how to build simple application using scala.

There are 4 config parameters hardcoded in the context object. 
Alternatively it's possible to uncomment all the lines of code referring to *typesafe config*(external lib), and use config files instead.
This part of the code is deactived as default since I have been asked not to use external libs.
 
The game can be played in 3 modes:
* Cpu: cpu vs cpu
* Single: human player vs cpu 
* Multi: human vs human  
Also it's possible to define how many matches there are in a game and the name of players.
