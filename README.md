This repository contains a simple software that plays Rock Paper Scissor. 
It is just a demonstration of how to build simple application using scala.

Instead of taking args parameter for configuration, the application parse a configuration file 
using typesafe config.  
The game can be played in 3 modes:
* Cpu: cpu vs cpu
* Single: human player vs cpu 
* Multi: human vs human
